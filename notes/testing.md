What’s in a good test failure bug report?
  -- What were you testing?
  -- What should it do?
  -- What was the output (actual behavior)?
  -- What was the expected output (expected behavior)?

Start by answering “what are you testing?”:
  -- What component aspect are you testing?
  -- What should the feature do? What specific behavior requirement are you testing?
